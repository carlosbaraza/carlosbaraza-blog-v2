# Blog

This is the paginated blog listing page. It displays all published blog posts sorted by `date_published` (newest first) with pagination.

Each post entry shows:
- Publication date
- Title (links to the post)
- Tags
- Summary

Posts are at root-level URLs: `/{slug}` (not `/blog/{slug}`).

See `blog/` directory for all post content and `url-index.md` for the full URL listing.
