export const authorBio = `Hello! I'm Carlos, and I am one of those people who learnt to code as a kid. Writing Software has been my passion since. As a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience, I commit to bringing technical knowledge (hopefully) and success (hopefully) to every project and organization I work with.

Currently, I am the CTO at [inpractise.com](https://inpractise.com). Previously worked at Bloomberg, Expedia, DAZN and others.

I love web development. I use modern but stable technologies, and I keep my knowledge updated. Playing music is my way to relax.`;
